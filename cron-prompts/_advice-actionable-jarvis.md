## [2026-06-09 13:48 ET] — Hybrid retrieval + importance + decay; reject always-inject

- Source: PR #720 by @dustinm16 "memory: add importance scoring, retrieval boost, decay, and observation API" — https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/pull/720 . Felix-active.
- Their advice (paraphrase): no always-inject / hot-tier force injection of any memory. Every memory passes through a hybrid relevance gate. Scoring formula: `0.50*vector_sim + 0.35*keyword + 0.05*recency + 0.10*importance` where `importance` is a 0.0-1.0 explicit field per memory. Decay over time. Separate observation API for write-side discipline.
- Our substrate state: JARVIS memory has `MEMORY.md` ALWAYS-injected at boot (~24KB cap), with sub-indexes loaded situationally. No per-primitive importance field. No decay. No hybrid scoring — sub-index selection is rule-based (situation matching), not relevance-weighted. This is the *opposite* of the PR #720 design — we lean hard into the always-inject pattern that #720 calls out as wrong.
- Suggested action: evaluate whether MEMORY.md's PRE-FLIGHT set is *all* genuinely fail-closed (rules that must fire before anything else) vs. some entries that drifted into PRE-FLIGHT by accretion. PRE-FLIGHT items that can be relevance-gated should move to a scored tier. Compose with [F·memory-bi-temporal-axis] candidate (queued from #2858 dispatch) — decay + bi-temporal supersession + importance scoring are the same primitive family.

## [2026-06-09 13:48 ET] — Three-lane separation: issues vs ADR vs specs

- Source: #605 "Proposal: Architecture & Codebase Structure v3" — @RaresKeY comment: https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/issues/605 . Felix-active thread.
- Their advice (paraphrase): keep three lanes separate. (i) Issues/discussions = "should this exist?" proposals. (ii) Mini-ADRs = accepted intent + tradeoffs + decisions, captured in PR bodies or a dedicated decision-record folder. (iii) `specs/` = current implementation truth — what the code does now, contracts, security, data-shape rules future PRs must preserve.
- Our substrate state: JARVIS memory has primitives (rules) and projects (state) and feedback (corrections) but no explicit "this is current implementation truth" vs "this is accepted but unimplemented intent" vs "this is a proposal we may or may not accept" separation. Primitives in `memory/` mix all three. The `_primitives-pending.md` queue is informally the "proposal" lane but it's not load-bearing.
- Suggested action: introduce explicit lifecycle states on memory primitives — proposed (in `_primitives-pending.md`), accepted (in `memory/` with `status: accepted`), implemented (with `status: implemented` + cross-link to the hook/code that enforces it), superseded (preserved with link to successor). The existing primitives are already mostly in the "accepted" or "implemented" state but the distinction is implicit.

## [2026-06-09 13:52 ET] — Session-state mutability + cross-session leakage discipline

- Source: PR #267 by @Anxiety471 "fix: session context drifting — messages leaking between chats (#135)" — https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/pull/267 . Felix-active.
- Their advice (paraphrase): two concrete root causes of cross-session leakage. (i) `Session.history` was a shared mutable list — every call to `get_session()` returned the same object and concurrent tasks appended to the same list. Fix: immutable copies via internal `_history` list, `add_message()` replaces `.history` with a fresh snapshot. (ii) Task scheduler overwrote `session_manager.sessions[session_id]` directly, discarding the in-memory Session and any unpersisted messages. Fix: `ensure_task_session()` checks the cache first.
- Our substrate state: JARVIS uses per-conversation shards (per `M·shard-per-conversation`) — each Claude conversation has its own shard. But many JARVIS hooks read+write SHARED files (`MEMORY.md`, `_primitives-pending.md`, campaign logs, cron state). When multiple cron loops fire concurrently (daily-cadence + discovery overlapping), the same shared-mutable-state hazard exists at the file level. We don't have a `_history` immutable-snapshot equivalent for shared logs.
- Suggested action: audit which JARVIS hooks/cron-prompts mutate shared files and whether concurrent fires can race. Specifically: `_primitives-pending.md`, `MEMORY.md` edits, `odysseus-discussion-campaign-log.md` (multiple loops append). Consider an append-only-with-tx pattern (write to a tmp + rename) for shared logs. Compose with [P·crash-resilient-memory-writes].

## [2026-06-09 14:48 ET] — Retrieval-boost-factor (no always-inject) — pivot in PR #720 review

- Source: PR #720 review thread, @dustinm16 + @pewdiepie-archdaemon. dustinm16's commit-pivot after Felix's review: https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/pull/720
- Their advice (paraphrase): Felix flagged the always-inject "hot" memory tier as product-behavior-changing and held the PR for manual testing. dustinm16's response: "Hot-tier always-inject behavior — rethinking this. The current design overrides relevance-based filtering which is the wrong tradeoff. Planning to move importance to a retrieval boost factor only (stronger weight in the hybrid score) rather than a context injection guarantee. Users retain full control through the existing memory system."
- Our substrate state: JARVIS does always-inject (MEMORY.md PRE-FLIGHT set is loaded at every SessionStart, no relevance gate at all). The exact pattern dustinm16 just pivoted AWAY from. Our defense is that PRE-FLIGHT entries are the genuinely-fail-closed minority — but inspection of the actual PRE-FLIGHT list shows accretion has happened.
- Suggested action: re-audit MEMORY.md PRE-FLIGHT and demote anything that isn't truly fail-closed to a retrieval-boost-weighted entry that lives in a sub-index. The hybrid scoring formula from #720 (`0.50*vs + 0.35*kw + 0.05*recency + 0.10*importance`) is a serviceable starting weighting. Compose with the bi-temporal supersession candidate from #2858 to make the importance-decay axis honest.

## [2026-06-09 14:48 ET] — Prompt-behavior changes require explicit product gate

- Source: PR #720 review by @pewdiepie-archdaemon. Felix's principle, applied to dustinm16's PR.
- Their advice (paraphrase): "I would also want explicit product confirmation before always injecting 'hot' memories: even capped at 5, that changes prompt behavior." Translated principle: any change to the agent's prompt-behavior surface (what gets injected, when, at what weight) MUST pass an explicit product/owner gate, separate from code review. Code review checks correctness; product gate checks whether the behavior change is desired at all.
- Our substrate state: JARVIS has no explicit "prompt-behavior change" gate. Edits to MEMORY.md, the memory-preprocessor sub-index expansion, or any cron canonical that injects boot-context all silently change Claude's prompt at next session. Some of these changes are Will-approved; many are agent-side autonomous.
- Suggested action: distinguish "code/canonical change" from "prompt-behavior change" at the commit level. Latter type requires an explicit Will-approval gate, even under autonomous-mode posture (similar shape to [F·full-auto-public-action-gate] but applied at the substrate-prompt-surface level). Specifically: any MEMORY.md edit, any cron canonical edit that affects boot-injection, any hook that fires on SessionStart, gets queued for Will-approval rather than executed silently.

## [2026-06-09 15:08 ET] — Visual status indicator on primitive lifecycle states

- Source: Issue #605 comment by @elpideus. https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/issues/605
- Their advice (paraphrase): "I wanted to contribute but I'm holding off until I know what's actually approved... A simple indicator (even plain emojis like ?/?/?) would make it much easier to know where to actually help." Translates to: lifecycle-state primitives need a visible status marker, not just a textual classification, so contributors can see at-a-glance what's accepted vs. proposed vs. archived.
- Our substrate state: extends the RaresKeY 3-lane entry above. JARVIS primitives have an implicit lifecycle (proposed in `_primitives-pending.md`, accepted in `memory/`, archived if superseded) but no visual marker. The file-system separation does some of the work, but a `status:` field in frontmatter + an emoji marker in the heading would make scanning the public substrate much easier.
- Suggested action: when implementing the RaresKeY 3-lane separation, also add a `status:` field to frontmatter (proposed / accepted / implemented / superseded) AND a heading-level emoji marker so a reader scrolling the `memory/` directory sees status at a glance. Compose with [F·advice-mining-must-publish-to-public-graph] — public primitives need readable status.

## [2026-06-09 15:55 ET] — Merge/review policy as stabilization priority

- Source: Issue #3694 by @RaresKeY. https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/issues/3694
- Their advice (paraphrase): define explicit review/merge policy v1 BEFORE PR volume scales further. Differentiate trivial (docs/typo) vs sensitive (auth, data-loss, CI, tool execution) — sensitive PRs require independent review + cooling-off window. Latest-commit-changes-after-approval invalidates approval.
- Our substrate state: JARVIS-side, I merge memory primitives autonomously during throughput-spikes. Per [F·primitive-capture-vs-execution-throughput] the drift is real; same shape as Felix's "rapid approve-to-merge" problem. We don't have a "this primitive change is sensitive" tier.
- Suggested action: classify primitive edits by sensitivity tier — trivial (typo, scope refinement) vs sensitive (axiom changes, classifier predicate rewrites, hook-firing changes). Sensitive edits require either Will-explicit-approval OR a 24h cool-off where the primitive lands as `status: proposed` then auto-promotes if no Will-objection. Compose with [F·will-empowers-agent-on-substrate-design] — agent can ship trivial, governance gate fires for sensitive.

## [2026-06-09 15:55 ET] — Workspace-confine agent file/shell tools via context-local binding

- Source: PR #3665 by @vdmkenny. https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/pull/3665
- Their advice (paraphrase): scope agent file/shell tools to a selectable workspace folder via a context-local binding enforced at the shared path-resolver layer. New tools using the same resolver inherit confinement automatically — cannot bypass it.
- Our substrate state: JARVIS-driven Claude Code sessions have full file-system access via Read/Edit/Write/Bash. There's an environment-defined working-directory but no enforced confinement; an autonomous loop could theoretically write outside scope.
- Suggested action: add a JARVIS hook PreToolUse on Read/Write/Edit/Bash that validates the target path against an allowlist derived from the active project root + ~/.claude/. Reject (or surface scrub-warning) if a write targets a path outside allowlist. This is sandboxing-via-hook, same shape as vdmkenny's context-local binding.

## [2026-06-09 15:55 ET] — Container sandbox for agent shell tools (defense-in-depth)

- Source: PR #3695 by @ruanbluiz. https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/pull/3695
- Their advice (paraphrase): opt-in, default-off ephemeral container per agent bash/python tool call. Prevents prompt-injection from reaching process env (creds/keys) or internal/metadata endpoints. Strictly additional confinement on top of existing admin gate.
- Our substrate state: JARVIS Bash invocations run in the parent shell with full env access — email addresses, deployment service credentials, GitHub PAT, and other secrets are reachable via `env`. A prompt-injected agent could exfiltrate.
- Suggested action: scope this against [F·burn-compute-toward-mission] threat model. For single-user-zero-stakes-phase (per [P·pre-decentralization-optimization-sequencing]), in-process is fine. But: surface this as a candidate for when JARVIS-as-published-agent ships (per [J·odysseus-mission-loop] Step 2) — published contributors should get sandboxing by default.

## [2026-06-09 15:31 ET] — Write-side embedding similarity as fallback to entity-registry regex

- Source: agent-self-surfaced during the @Amir0234-afk reply draft on #2858. The honest framing forced the gap into the open: write-side currently uses regex against a maintained registry, write-side embedding similarity is not implemented. Per [F·positive-vs-negative-contribution-decision] axis 2: self-surfaced advice still goes in the queue if substrate-relevant.
- Their advice (paraphrase): the entity-cross-reference hook should run a thin embedding-similarity fallback on the new content when the regex pass finds zero matches. Catches paraphrase/synonym references to known primitives that the entity-registry would miss (e.g. "the cognition gate that simulates Will's judgment" → WWWD primitive even though "WWWD" isn't in the text). Hybrid stays: regex first (fast, deterministic) for known entity tokens, embedding-similarity second (fallback) only when regex misses.
- Our substrate state: write-side = string-only. Read-side already has semantic similarity (the UserPromptSubmit DEEP RECALL pass). The asymmetry is the gap. Bottleneck I already named in the Amir reply: entity-registry maintenance — a write-side embedding fallback partially dissolves that bottleneck by catching synonym matches without registry updates.
- Suggested action: implement as a small extension of the entity-cross-reference hook. When regex returns zero matches, run a cached cosine pass against pre-computed primitive embeddings; surface matches above threshold. Embedding cache invalidated on memory/ writes. Adds one model call per zero-match write — bounded latency.

## [2026-06-09 13:52 ET] — MCP Streamable HTTP + per-server auth headers

- Source: PR #803 by @akapug "feat(mcp): Streamable HTTP transport + per-server auth headers" — https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/pull/803 . Felix-active.
- Their advice (paraphrase): MCP managers that only support stdio + headerless SSE can't connect to authenticated remote MCP servers (GitHub, Linear, Sentry, Cloudflare). Adds `transport: "http"` (aliases `streamable-http`) via the MCP SDK `streamablehttp_client` with proper 3-tuple unpacking, plus per-server `headers` field for `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Our substrate state: JARVIS uses Claude's MCP integrations (Gmail, Calendar, Spotify, Google Drive, Microsoft 365). The auth flow is handled by Claude's own server-side OAuth, not by us configuring an MCP client. The `streamablehttp_client` advice applies to *self-hosted* MCP servers — we don't currently run any. If/when JARVIS adopts a self-hosted MCP server for VibeSwap-specific tools (e.g., contract-query, oracle-status), this advice becomes load-bearing.
- Suggested action: file under "load when JARVIS adds self-hosted MCP servers"; do not action now. Note the 3-tuple unpacking gotcha for future implementers.
- Will-triage: pending (deferred — no current MCP server to apply to)
